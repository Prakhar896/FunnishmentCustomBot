## FunnishmentCustomBot

# About The Project

I made this custom Discord Bot for aa private server on Discord as I felt like the bots out there didn't really have what I needed. Its called the FunnishmentCustomBot because, well the name of the server is Funnishment....so yea.

## Usage

Upon adding the bot to the server, ensure that you have Administrator permissions and that the bot has them too. 

Do $botinit <server's log channel id> to initialise the bot and set the channel where the bot will send logs as you use the commands.
